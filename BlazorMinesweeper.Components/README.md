# RazorMinesweeper

The perfect component to add to ANY business application.
(It's just minesweeper.)

## How to use
To use the package simply add a nuget reference to the library [found here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RazorMinesweeper/) and add the reference in your _Imports.razor file. 
Then you are all set to create Minesweeper components in your app!
The component accepts three parameters: **Width**, **Height** and **Mine Count**. 

## CSS
This library comes prepacked with a basic CSS package. You need to reference the CSS file in your App.razor for it to work. Use the following syntax
``` html
<link href="_content/RazorMinesweeper/css/minesweeper.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
You can also add your own stylesheet with the same classes that exist in the css file! :)
